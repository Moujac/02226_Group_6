# How to Run the Analysis Tool

Follow these steps to run the analysis tool:

1. Navigate to the main directory.
2. Run `main.py` with the chosen testcase path as an argument.

## Accessing the Tool

Use the tool via the CLI. Provide the base path to a folder containing the input streams and topology configuration files.

This repository contains the tool under the folder titled main, and the test_cases folder includes multiple test cases which we have used for the analysis of our tool.

### Example

For the binomial test case:

```bash
py main.py ..\test_cases\test_case_binomial\
